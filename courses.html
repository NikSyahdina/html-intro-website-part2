                language. It provides students with a thorough look at thebasic
                constructs of the Java programming language such as its basic
                data types and operations. It also emphasizes on the use of
                standard Java APIs that allow students to develop text-basedand
                GUI applications. It will also provide the programming
                techniques on exception handlingand input/output files. At the
                end of this course, students should be able to use
                thebasicconstructs in object-oriented programming and utilize
                the selected Java APIs
